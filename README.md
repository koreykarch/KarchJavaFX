# KarchJavaFX
This is my JavaFX project
I made a matching game.
It has a game view, author view, and home view
The home view is built into the main class in a way, but the game and author classes have their own Pane designs
Basically, when a view button is pressed, it switches the rootPane's center element to the Pane from either the Author, home, or game class.
